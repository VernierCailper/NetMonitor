# NetMonitor


#The program can get speed of internet connection, download(for Chinese Words“下载”) and upload(for Chinese Words“上传”).And it can select Network Interface to be showed for multi-Network Interfaces. But it still can’t choose Network Interface automatically. Besides a gif showed on surface to let it don’t looked too bad. Picture can be changed in resource file, and the TransparencyKey should be transformed if needed. A limit added to make sure no more one instances being running at same time.
