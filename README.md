# NetMonitor
#This C# program is a small test for me and it will help me know how to work on GitHub. Codes will be refreshed to be read easily and friendly.

#The program can get speed of internet connection, download(for Chinese Words“下载”) and upload(for Chinese Words“上传”).And it can select Network Interface to be showed for multi-Network Interfaces. But it still can’t choose Network Interface automatically. Besides a gif showed on surface to let it don’t looked too bad. Picture can be changed in resource file, and the TransparencyKey should be transformed if needed. A limit added to make sure no more one instances being running at same time.

#Any questions or advice, please send email at Zark.Github#outlook.com

#Thank you!
